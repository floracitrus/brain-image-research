# Brain image research on Alzheimer's disease
Tested different machine learning, neural network to help on detection of Alzheimer's disease, this is studied by team P=NP and supervised under Lina Yao team Data Dynamic.

Abstract 
Cognitive impairment is currently heavily affecting
the elderly population. Due to the continual growth of computer
vision and artificial intelligence, it is possible to combine this
medical problem with existing artificial intelligent algorithms. We
applied the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
dataset to explore the brain connectivities by applying and
comparing between several advanced neural network and graph
model such as GCN, st-GCN, NN. We achieved 76% accuracy
for the predictions of cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer
Disease (AD) and Cognitive Normal (CN) state and have shown
a step-by-step pathway to achieve these results and explore the
problem.
